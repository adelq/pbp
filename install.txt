# this is a automatic install script for pbp
# use:
# wget -O - https://raw.github.com/stef/pbp/master/install.txt | sh -
# to install pbp automatically
# you possibly need to run (or an equivalent command)
# sudo apt-get install git python-virtualenv gcc python-dev
# to satisfy all basic dependencies

# this is neccessary as libsodium needs to be compiled as a
# dependency.
